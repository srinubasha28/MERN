           <h3 align="center">Non-cooperation Movement</h3> <br> 
           <h3>Adopt swadeshi principles</h3> <br>
           The Non-cooperation Movement was launched on 5th September 1920 by the Indian National Congress (INC) under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi. In September 1920, in Congress session in Calcutta, the party introduced the Non-Cooperation programme. The period of the non-cooperation movement is taken as September 1920 to February 1922. It signified a new chapter in the history of the Indian freedom struggle.
           The Non-Cooperation Movement was launched in the wake of a series of events including the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre and was called off because of Chauri Chaura incident of 1922.
           Non-Cooperation Movement and Mahatma Gandhi Mahatma Gandhi was the main force behind the non-cooperation movement.
            <p>In March 1920, he issued a manifesto declaring a doctrine of the non-violent non-cooperation movement.
                Gandhi, through this manifesto, wanted people to:
          Adopt swadeshi habits including hand spinning & weavingWork for the eradication of untouchability from societyGandhi travelled across the nation in 1921 explaining the tenets of the movement.</p>
           
           <h3>Features of the Non-Cooperation Movement</h3>
           The movement was essentially a peaceful and non-violent protest against the British government in India.
           Indians were asked to relinquish their titles and resign from nominated seats in the local bodies as a mark of protest.
           People were asked to resign from their government jobs.
           People were asked to withdraw their children from government-controlled or aided schools and colleges.
           People were asked to boycott foreign goods and use only Indian-made goods.
           People were asked to boycott the elections to the legislative councils.
           People were asked not to serve in the British army.
           It was also planned that if the above steps did not bring results, people would refuse to pay their taxes.
           The INC also demanded Swarajya or self-government.
           Only completely non-violent means would be employed to get the demands fulfilled.
           The non-cooperation movement was a decisive step in the independence movement because, for the first time, the INC was ready to forego constitutional means to achieve self-rule.
           Gandhiji had assured that Swaraj would be achieved in a year if this movement was continued to completion.

            <h3>Causes of Non-Cooperation Movement</h3>
           <p>Resentment at the British after the war: Indians thought that in return for the extensive support of manpower and resources they had provided to Britain during the First World War, they would be rewarded by autonomy at the end of the war. But the Government of India Act 1919 was dissatisfactory. In addition, the British also passed repressive acts like the Rowlatt Act which further angered many Indians who felt betrayed by the rulers despite their wartime support.
           Home Rule Movement: The Home Rule Movement started by Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak set the stage for the non-cooperation movement. The extremists and the moderates of the INC were united and the Lucknow Pact also saw solidarity between the Muslim League and the Congress Party. The return of the extremists gave the INC a militant character.
           Economic hardships due to World War I: India’s participation in the war caused a lot of economic hardships to the people. Prices of goods began to soar which affected the common man. Peasants also suffered because the prices of agricultural products did not increase. All this led to resentment against the government.</p>
           <p>The Rowlatt Act and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre: The repressive Rowlatt Act and the brutal massacre at Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar had a profound effect on the Indian leaders and the people. Their faith in the British system of justice was broken and the whole country rallied behind its leaders who were pitching for a more aggressive and firm stance against the government.
           The Khilafat Movement: During the First World War, Turkey, which was one of the Central Powers, had fought against the British. After Turkey’s defeat, the Ottoman caliphate was proposed to be dissolved. Muslims regarded Sultan of Turkey as their Caliph (religious head of the Muslims). The Khilafat movement was launched under the leadership of  Ali Brothers (Maulana Mohammed Ali and Maulana Shaukat Ali), Maulana Azad, Hakim Ajmal Khan, and Hasrat Mohani. It got the support from Mahatma Gandhi to persuade the British government not to abolish the caliphate. The leaders of this movement accepted the non-cooperation movement of Gandhiji and led a joint protest against the British.
