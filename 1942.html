            <h3 align="center">Quit India Movement</h3><br>
            Quit India Movement, mass protest movement during 1942–43 against the colonial British raj’s political and military control of India. The movement, which took place against the backdrop of World War II, was initially planned by Mahatma Gandhi and his followers in the Indian National Congress (Congress Party) as a nonviolent action. However, attempts by the British authorities to prevent the protests by arresting the Congress leaders backfired and triggered an escalation of violence that, by the end of the turmoil, resulted in the deaths of at least 1,000 Indians, as well as the arrests of roughly 60,000 by the end of 1943. Though the movement was unsuccessful in its goal of forcing the immediate decolonization of India, it served as an important demonstration of anti-colonial sentiment in Indian society directed toward the British raj. Moreover, the desire of British authorities to avoid a repetition of the chaos caused by the Quit India Movement lent urgency to the decolonization of India in the postwar period.

<h4>Historical background</h4>

Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi, 1931.
The Quit India Movement was not the first mass protest movement in India against British colonialism. The Indian Mutiny of 1857–59 saw Indian soldiers turn on their British army leaders, and the fighting resulted in the replacement of British East Indian Company control with direct colonial rule under the British crown beginning in 1858. Additionally, nonviolent protests for independence led by Gandhi included the noncooperation movement of 1920–22 and other acts of nonviolent civil disobedience such as the Salt March in 1930. The Quit India Movement was Gandhi’s last attempt at a satyagraha campaign against British colonial rule prior to India’s independence in 1947.

<p>The Quit India Movement was instigated by Britain’s unilateral declaration of war on the Axis powers in 1939. In conjunction with that declaration, on September 3, 1939, Viceroy of India Linlithgow (1936–43) proclaimed that India was also at war with Germany, thereby drawing the Indian population into the conflict. With the declaration of war, Britain reinstated the Defense of India Act (1915) and essentially declared martial law in the colony. The involvement of India in the war outraged many Indian political leaders, who, despite a range of opinions on the just nature of the war, thought it was morally wrong for the British to force their subjects into the fighting (by the war’s end 2.5 million Indians had served in the British armed forces, though the majority were volunteers) without consulting Indian leadership and to use Indian resources for the effort.</p>

As the war continued and Japanese armies swept through Britain’s Southeast Asian colonies—Singapore, Malaya (now Malaysia), and Burma (now Myanmar)—a faction of the Congress Party began to call for India to gain immediate independence from Britain in order to avoid a Japanese invasion. This faction was led by Gandhi, who was concerned that British presence in India would invite Japanese aggression. He argued that India should be allowed to make its own peace treaty with Japan and that, in the event of an invasion by Japan, Indians should resist only through nonviolent means rather than be forced by the British into military conflict.

<p>Wanting to prevent unrest during the war, the British government sent Sir Stafford Cripps to India in March 1942 to suggest a compromise known as the “Cripps Offer,” under which Indian politicians would cooperate with the colonial government for the duration of the war and then be given dominion status—alongside Canada, Australia, and other former British colonies—and increased autonomy afterward. The offer included an “opt-out” clause allowing certain provinces to choose not to be a part of a united India—a provision that was received positively by Mohammed Ali Jinnah, whose Muslim League desired the creation of a separate Muslim-majority nation to be called Pakistan, but was viewed negatively by Gandhi and Congress, who vehemently opposed any potential partition of India. The offer was swiftly rejected by most leaders of the Indian independence movement, and Gandhi irately called the offer “a post-dated cheque on a bank that was failing.”

The perception that Britain did not take their demands seriously hardened the position of some Congress politicians and strengthened calls to engage in action toward independence. In the shadow of the growing military presence of British and American troops in India, and with the increasing food shortages in India due to the war effort, Indians continued to suffer. Japanese forces moved into the Bay of Bengal, attacked British ships, and bombed the east coast ports of Visakhapatnam and Kakinada, thus making the threat of full-scale war on Indian soil seem imminent. Gandhi became more adamant about the departure of the British colonists and less concerned about internal squabbles among Indian leadership. He notably demanded of the British in his magazine Harijan on May 24, 1942: “Leave India to God. If that is too much leave her to anarchy.”

On July 14, 1942, the Congress Party passed its “Quit India” resolution calling for an immediate end to British rule in India and authorizing Gandhi to lead a mass nonviolent protest movement if independence was not granted. The slogan “Quit India” was coined by mayor of Bombay (now Mumbai) Yusuf Meherally. When the British government failed to meet its demands, the Congress Party met in Bombay and voted on August 8 for the initiation of the Quit India Movement. During that meeting, Gandhi delivered his “Do or Die” speech, in which he famously declared: “The mantra is ‘Do or Die.’ We shall either free India or die in the attempt; we shall not live to see the perpetuation of our slavery.” Despite earlier disagreements within the party, only a small number of delegates at the meeting opposed implementing the Quit India resolution.

Others within the independence movement outside of Congress opposed the decision to engage in a widespread mass protest, notably B.R. Ambedkar and Mohammed Ali Jinnah. They viewed the Quit India resolution as a hasty power play by Gandhi to achieve Indian independence and keep the Congress Party in charge. From their perspective, independence on these terms would leave India without sufficient safeguards in place for the protection of the Dalits, Ambedkar’s constituency, and the Muslims, for whom Jinnah’s Muslim League advocated.

<p>The British response to these protests was often brutal. The military, already present in India in larger than usual numbers for the war effort, was deployed to disperse rioters, and in a few cases airplanes were instructed to fire their machine guns on the crowds from the air. Parts of the United Provinces, Bihar, the North-West Frontier, and Bengal (now West Bengal state and Bangladesh) were bombed and strafed by pilots as the British raj resolved to crush all Indian resistance as swiftly as possible. Thousands of people were killed or wounded, and roughly 60,000 arrests were made in the first few months. Most of those arrested, along with the leaders of the Congress Party, were imprisoned for the duration of World War II to prevent further protests, although Gandhi was released on May 6, 1944, because of his failing health.
